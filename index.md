# Welcome to Nature's Attendance

This blog is all about Animals. You are going to learn about animal species and their habbitats, diet and more.

## Saola

The saola was discovered in May 1992 during a joint survey carried out by the Ministry of Forestry of Vietnam and WWF in north-central Vietnam. The team found a skull with unusual long, straight horns in a hunter's home and knew it was something extraordinary. The find proved to be the first large mammal new to science in more than 50 years and one of the most spectacular zoological discoveries of the 20th century.

Saola (pronounced: sow-la) are recognized by two parallel horns with sharp ends, which can reach 20 inches in length and are found on both males and females. Meaning “spindle horns” in Vietnamese, they are a cousin of cattle but resemble an antelope. Saola have striking white markings on the face and large maxillary glands on the muzzle, which could be used to mark territory or attract mates. They are found only in the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos.

- STATUS Critically Endangered

- POPULATION Unknown

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Pseudoryx nghetinhensis

- HEIGHT Average 33 inches at the shoulder

- WEIGHT 176-220 lbs

- HABITATS Evergreen forests with little or no dry season

### Fun Fact
Often called the Asian unicorn, little is known about the enigmatic saola in the two decades since its discovery. None exist in captivity and this rarely-seen mammal is already critically endangered. Scientists have categorically documented saola in the wild on only four occasions to date.


## African Elephant

![Image](https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/882/images/hero_full/African_Elephant_7.27.2012_hero_and_circle_HI_53941.jpg?1345532748)

The African elephant is the largest animal walking the Earth. Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in African elephants and grow throughout their lifetime. There are two subspecies of African elephants—the Savanna (or bush) elephant and the Forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks curve outwards. In addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are straighter and point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the two subspecies.

Forest elephants, a distinct subspecies of African elephants, are uniquely adapted to the forest habitat of the Congo Basin, but are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory trade. It is estimated that probably one quarter to one third of the total African elephant population is made up of forest elephants.

- STATUS Vulnerable

- POPULATION Approximately 415,000 in the wild

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Loxodonta africana

- HEIGHT Shoulder height is 11 feet

- WEIGHT 6 tons

- LENGTH 19-24 feet

## Amur Leopard

![Image](https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/878/images/hero_full/amur-leopard_99144569.jpg?1345532564)

People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa but in the Russian Far East, a rare subspecies has adapted to life in the temperate forests that make up the northern-most part of the species’ range. Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. This incredible animal has been reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.

The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are not taken by other predators. It has been reported that some males stay with females after mating, and may even help with rearing the young. Several males sometimes follow and fight over a female. They live for 10-15 years, and in captivity up to 20 years. The Amur leopard is also known as the Far East leopard, the Manchurian leopard or the Korean leopard.

- STATUS Critically Endangered

- POPULATION More than 84 individuals

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Panthera pardus orientalis

- WEIGHT 70 -105 pounds

- HABITATS Temperate, Broadleaf, and Mixed Forests


## Red Panda

The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body and thick russet fur. The belly and limbs are black, and there are white markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes. Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees. Almost 50% of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably for warmth. Primarily an herbivore, the name panda is said to come from the Nepali word ‘ponya,’ which means bamboo or plant eating animal.

- STATUS Endangered

- POPULATION less than 10,000 individuals

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Ailurus fulgens

- LENGTH 2 feet

- HABITATS Temperate forests


## Brown Bear

![Image](https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/16934/images/hero_full/Medium_WW266637.jpg?1551469111)

Few animals have captured the imagination like brown bears. They can stand on two legs, walk on the soles of their feet, pick things up with their “fingers,” and often eat what we eat. This—coupled with their ability to communicate with one another through scratch marks left on trees, smells and sounds—establishes a similarity to our own way of life. Some of the largest living carnivores, brown bears have fallen prey to hunting and other conflicts with humans.

- STATUS Least Concern

- POPULATION 110,000

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Ursus arctos

-HEIGHT 3.35 feet to shoulders

- WEIGHT Up to 1,500 lbs

- LENGTH 6.5 feet

- HABITATS Forests, Tundra


## Borneo Pygmy Elephant

![Image](https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/1667/images/hero_full/HI_113471.jpg?1345600398)

The smallest in size of Asian elephant subspecies, the pygmy elephants of Borneo are baby-faced with oversized ears, plump bellies and tails so long they sometimes drag on the ground as they walk. They are also more gentle-natured than their Asian elephant counterparts.

Once believed to be remnants of a domesticated herd given to the Sultan of Sulu in the 17th century, pygmy elephants were determined by WWF to be genetically different from other Asian elephants. DNA evidence proved these elephants were isolated about 300,000 years ago from their cousins on mainland Asia and Sumatra. Over time, they became smaller with relatively larger ears, longer tails and straighter tusks. Today, the pygmy elephants of Borneo are the smallest elephants in Asia.

- STATUS Endangered

- POPULATION Approximately 1,500

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Elephas maximus borneensis

- HEIGHT 8.2 - 9.8 feet

- HABITATS Forests


## Macaw

The Amazonian rain forest is a bird lover's paradise, home to over a thousand different species, including the blue-and-yellow macaw. Macaws are highly intelligent, mate for life and can live up to 60 years. The vibrant color and pattern of their feathers make them a popular species in the illegal pet trade, which has devastated populations of wild exotic birds. WWF supports efforts to phase out importing wild birds to the United States and encourages captive breeding as an alternative to illegal capture.

- STATUS Least Concern

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Ara ararauna


## Giant Panada

This peaceful creature with a distinctive black and white coat is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. The panda also has a special significance for WWF because it has been WWF's logo since our founding in 1961.

Pandas live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat from 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, a formidable task for which they use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.

A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but can grow to up to 330 pounds as an adult. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk. 

- STATUS Vulnerable

- POPULATION 1,864 in the wild

- SCIENTIFIC NAME Ailuropoda melanoleuca

- HEIGHT Adults can grow to more than four feet.

- WEIGHT 220–330 pounds

- HABITATS Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of southwest China

### Fun Facts

Despite their exalted status and relative lack of natural predators, pandas are still at risk. Severe threats from humans have left just over 1,800 pandas in the wild.


## Sloth

![Image](https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/6526/images/hero_full/sloth_%28c%29_Jorge_Salas_International_Expeditions.JPG?1394634201)

Sloths—the sluggish tree-dwellers of Central and South America—spend their lives in the tropical rain forests. They move through the canopy at a rate of about 40 yards per day, munching on leaves, twigs and buds. Sloths have an exceptionally low metabolic rate and spend 15 to 20 hours per day sleeping. And surprisingly enough, the long-armed animals are excellent swimmers. They occasionally drop from their treetop perches into water for a paddle.

There are two different types of sloths, two-toed and three-toed, and six species:

- Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus)
- Maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus)
- Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus)
- Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus)
- Linnaeus’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)
- Hoffman’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni)

Of those, the pygmy sloth is critically endangered and the maned sloth is vulnerable.

- HABITATS Rain Forest
